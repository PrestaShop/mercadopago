##Features##

**Standard checkout**

This feature allows merchants to have a standard checkout. It includes all
payment methods (i.e. all credit cards, bar code payment, account money) and all window types (i.e. redirect, iframe, modal, blank and popup). Customization is not allowed.

**Credit Card Customized Checkout**

This feature will allow merchants to have a customized checkout for credit card
payment. Thus, it will be possible to customize its look and feel, customers won’t be redirected away to complete the payment, and it will also reduce the checkout steps, improving conversion rates.

**Ticket Checkout**

This feature allows merchants to have a customized ticket checkout, according to each country's ticket method (i.e Boleto in Brazil, RapiPago in Argentina, etc).  Thus, it will be possible to customize its look and feel, customers won’t be redirected away to complete the payment, and it will also reduce the checkout steps, improving conversion rates. The ticket link will be shown and when the customer click on it, another tab with the ticket will be opened.
